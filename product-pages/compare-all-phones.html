                <p>If money is no object, the S24 Ultra is the best smartphone you can buy right now.</p>
                <p>Samsung has put that high price tag to good use, delivering a superb user experience with no real weaknesses. And there are a catalogue of major strengths, from incredible overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 performance to five distinct camera lenses, each of which more than hold their own.</p>
                <p>You still get a gorgeous 6.8-inch AMOLED display and built-in S Pen, yet this is still a two-day phone for many people in terms of battery life.</p>
                <p>What‚Äôs more, the software experience is the best it‚Äôs ever been, with a slick One UI skin over Android 14 and seven years of both OS and security updates. A selection of genuinely useful AI features are the icing on the cake.</p>
                <p>The S24 Ultra‚Äôs price and big, bulky design aren‚Äôt for everyone. But it‚Äôs the most complete smartphone money can buy.</p>

                <p>Xiaomi‚Äôs flagships have taken excellent photos for a few years now, but the 14 Ultra takes things to the next level. It‚Äôs the first smartphone that can genuinely replace a DSLR for most people, such is the quality and versatility of the system on offer. It includes four 50Mp rear lenses and a 32Mp selfie camera, all of which take superb photos in basically any environment.</p>
                <p>And while expensive, the optional Photography Kit accessory makes the experience even closer to a real camera.</p>
                <p>With a gorgeous design, stunning display, great performance and solid battery life supported by 90W fast charging, the 14 Ultra is one of the few phones that justifies its sky-high price tag. However, that also makes it unaffordable for many people, while the HyperOS software experience still isn‚Äôt great.</p>
                <p>Those two factors prevent it from being higher in this list, but if photography is your top priority, this is the phone to buy. If you‚Äôd rather something more affordable, the regular Xiaomi 14 is nearly as good when it comes to photography.</p>

                <p>If neither of the options above appeals to you, a Pixel 9 is probably your best bet. And if you want the absolute best experience, the newly-branded Pixel 9 Pro XL is the one to go for.</p>
                <p>While not quite the standout phone we saw with the Pixel 8 Pro, the 9 Pro XL still delivers a compelling experience in almost all key areas.</p>
                <p>The cameras are the highlight once again, offering vibrant, high-contrast photos while maintaining key details. That includes in low-light conditions, even if the brightening is by no means true to life. A quality ultrawide lens and 5x optical zoom from the telephoto make it an impressively versatile camera system, while selfies from the upgraded front lens are excellent.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, the excellent 6.8-inch display is a joy to use, while Google‚Äôs Tensor G4 chipset delivers solid performance. And the build quality is higher than ever, even if the move to a more generic design will disappoint some people.</p>
                <p>Google continues to ace the software experience, even if the 9 Pro XL runs Android 14 out of the box and AI features are hit-and-miss. Google‚Äôs commitment to seven years of both OS and security updates is still yet to be beaten on any phone.</p>
                <p>Battery life is decent rather than a key strength, while 37W charging feels slow. Ultimately, whether you buy the 9 Pro XL depends on whether you think the even higher price tag is worth it.</p>
                <p>If not, consider the Pixel 9 Pro or regular Pixel 9 instead, though there are downgrades to be aware of.</p>

                <p>From the 2024 line-up, the iPhone 16 Plus is the sweet spot with its combination of size, price, and features.</p>
                <p>Of course, like all the 16 range, it lacks Apple Intelligence at launch, so you may want to wait to find out if that‚Äôs any good if it‚Äôs a critical part of your buying decision.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, you‚Äôre getting an all-rounder you know will get AI features in the near future, and it‚Äôs closer to the Pro Max than usual considering the Action Button has now trickled down and the new Camera Control button isn‚Äôt exclusive to the Pro models.</p>
                <p>The screen isn‚Äôt as big or impressive as the Pro Max, and you get a regular A18 chipset, but these will be plenty good enough for most people. You also miss out on a telephoto lens and 1TB storage, but again, a lot of people won‚Äôt mind these trade-offs for a more reasonable price.</p>

                <p>For a few years now, Google‚Äôs A-Series handsets have offered the best value for money in the entire smartphone market. However, despite plenty of strengths, the Pixel 8a has been usurped in this regard by the OnePlus Nord 4.</p>
                <p>That starts with superb build quality, with one piece of sturdy aluminium extending across the back and sides of the phone. At the front is a gorgeous 120Hz OLED screen, supplemented by strong performance and all-day battery life.</p>
                <p>Provided you‚Äôre a fan of the design, the compromises here are concentrated around the cameras. There‚Äôs no telephoto lens, meaning zoom shots are disappointing, while the ultrawide OnePlus has opted for instead flatters to deceive.</p>
                <p>However, if you primarily use the main lens anyway, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. And with six years of security updates, the Nord 4‚Äôs longevity is almost as good as the Pixel 8a‚Äôs.</p>
                <p>Overall, it‚Äôs the leading choice if you‚Äôre in the market for a mid-range phone.</p>

                <p>When you think of flip phones released in 2024, Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy Z Flip 6 is probably the first one that comes to mind. But while it is worth considering, the Motorola Razr 50 Ultra (known as the Razr+ (2024) in some markets) is a better choice for most people.</p>
                <p>The 4-inch, 165Hz outer screen is the main reason for this. Not only is it significantly larger than rivals, you can run any app you like on it without any complicated workarounds. The 6.9-inch, 165Hz internal display is just as impressive, with a crease that‚Äôs barely noticeable.</p>
                <p>While not quite as good as the best camera phones, the Razr 50 Ultra‚Äôs rear cameras can take great shots in a range of environments. However, Motorola has gone for a 2x telephoto rather than an ultrawide lens, while the internal selfie camera isn‚Äôt very good.</p>
                <p>But with slick software (despite some cover screen bugs), solid battery life and decent charging speeds, Motorola is onto a winner. The Z Flip 6 is better in some areas, including long software support, but the Razr is a better all-round pick for most people.</p>
                <p>If you‚Äôre looking for something more affordable, consider the regular Razr 50 instead. And if a book-style foldable is your preference, go for the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p>

                <p>With its size and price, it won‚Äôt be the right fit for everyone, but Apple throws everything at this beast, so it‚Äôs the one to get if you want to max out in all areas.</p>
                <p>The phone builds on what Apple does best ‚Äì elegant design, powerful performance, and excellent cameras. And it‚Äôs the Max that gets the best of all worlds as long as it‚Äôs not too big for you to handle on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>While it might look almost identical to its predecessor, those upgrading from an iPhone 14 or earlier will experience a much bigger jump.</p>
                <p>Display, photography, and performance are the main perks here with a huge and stunning 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR OLED, plenty of camera tech including the new Camera Control, A18 Pro chipset, and the best battery life on an iPhone.</p>
                <p>The main downside right now, and this applies to the whole range, is that Apple Intelligence isn‚Äôt available. If this is an important element, then you may want to wait until the verdict is in on Apple‚Äôs AI features.</p>

                <p>The OnePlus 12 is significantly more expensive than the OnePlus 11, meaning it no longer takes the title of best value flagship.</p>
                <p>However, it still undercuts most flagships on price, yet delivers everything most people are looking for in a smartphone.</p>
                <p>Performance from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset is superb, while the 120Hz AMOLED screen delivers a top-tier viewing experience. Even the main and telephoto cameras, a slight weakness of some earlier OnePlus phones, are now among the best around. However, the wide angle and selfie cameras could still be improved.</p>
                <p>Battery life is strong, and it‚Äôs nice to see the 100W fast charging is now combined with fast 50W wireless charging.</p>
                <p>OnePlus‚Äô OxygenOS skin (now over Android 14) is still excellent, though the commitment to four OS updates and five years of security patches is a step down from the best of Google and Samsung (both seven).</p>
                <p>But overall, the OnePlus 12 is a superb smartphone that‚Äôs easy to recommend. If you‚Äôre looking for a foldable, consider the OnePlus Open instead.</p>

                <p>CMF, Nothing‚Äôs sub-brand, has previously focused on wearables and audio products.</p>

                <p>Its design is the clear highlight, with a back panel that can easily be swapped out and attachment for a lanyard, kickstand, or card wallet, all of which CMF sells as optional extras. However, even if you don‚Äôt care about any of that stuff, the Phone 1 has strong performance and an attractive display, both of which are must-haves on a modern smartphone.</p>
                <p>Battery life is decent, while Nothing‚Äôs unique take on Android combines a unique look with no bloatware.</p>
                <p>The lack of NFC (and so no support for contactless payments) is the biggest potential dealbreaker, while the cameras and water resistance could do with work. Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy A15 5G or A15 4G are the cheap phones to get if you value long software support, too.</p>

                <p>For many people, the S24+ is the sweet spot in Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S24 range. While you miss out on the S Pen support and Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (in the UK; US models still get it), it‚Äôs still a fantastic phone in its own right.</p>
                <p>The Exynos 2400-powered model we tested still offers very good performance, especially when combined with that high-quality 6.7-inch display and premium design. The cameras are good and battery life is excellent.</p>
                <p>Other key features from the S24 Ultra do make it here, including the useful AI features, and superb seven years of software updates.</p>
                <p>Besides slow charging and a still-premium price tag, there‚Äôs very little to dislike here.</p>
